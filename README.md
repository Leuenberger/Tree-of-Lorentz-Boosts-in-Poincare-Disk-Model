This Jupyter Notebook program generates the Poincare disk model illustrations appearing in our paper 'Emergence of Minkowski-Spacetime by Simple Deterministic Graph Rewriting' (https://scholar.google.ch/scholar?oi=bibs&cluster=14426533676247745938&btnI=1&hl=en)

Our notebook firstly calculates the coordinates of the points and then uses cduck's hyperbolic library to render the images. 

pip3 install hyperbolic  
pip3 install drawSvg
