This Jupyter Notebook program generates the Poincare disk model illustrations appearing in the paper 'Emergence of Minkowski-Spacetime by Simple Deterministic Graph Rewriting' which was prepublished on arXiv here: https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.03388  
Our notebook firstly calculates the coordinates of the points and then uses cduck's hyperbolic library to render the images.  
pip3 install hyperbolic  
pip3 install drawSvg
